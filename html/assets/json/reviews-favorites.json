We have found it to be particularly useful for when there are board users who need to work remotely.\r\nThe flexibility in board design has allowed us to use it for other applications too, such as Story Board Mapping and Retrospectives.  We can collaborate remotely on what would usually involve Post-It notes if we were in the same location.",

        "description": "LeanKit in our company is a foundation of our workflow since more than 2 years. Now I can't imagine my work without the Kanban methodology. The great thing about LeanKit are the comments, which allow for strict communication within the card context. The thing which definitely needs more work are the attachments. It's not easy to attach e.g. image file and it's not easy to view attached file. The API and API documentation is a little bit of a mess, but we managed to create an integration which helps us track down the time spent on every single LeanKit card!",

LeanKit makes it easier for us to see where all the individual jobs are in their respective production cycles at a glance. We can order materials as needed, without carrying an over load of product on the floor & keep our vendors updated on delivery schedules. LeanKit has also streamlined our interoffice communications by letting us know where & when individuals need to step in & preform their own tasks.",
