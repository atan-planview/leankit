        "description": "Leankit is a fantastic visual production status/progress/pipeline/organization tool! We're using it to optimize the workflow and keep track of hundreds of products at different stages of testing, and fulfillment. The only thing we would like to see improved is the ability to link more than one card together, and have the status of one update the other - or options similar to that functionality.",

        "description": "Love the product. I use it constantly for Personal and work Kanban. It's fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I'd like to be better is how billing works. It's strange that I should have to log in to NetSuite to manage my subscription. It's a hassle, and if the product wasn't so good, I'd consider dropping it for that reason. Fortunately, the product is really good.",

We have found it to be particularly useful for when there are board users who need to work remotely.\r\nThe flexibility in board design has allowed us to use it for other applications too, such as Story Board Mapping and Retrospectives.  We can collaborate remotely on what would usually involve Post-It notes if we were in the same location.",
